# plotscripts
Scripts for plotting and fitting data

These scripts are intended for students of the natural sciences (chemistry, physics etc) to easily plot data without needing to think too much about the methods. I intend them to be as simple as possible and to be used only for "easy stuff" - mostly plotting polynominal fits to data. For analysis of spectroscopic data I recommend using other programs than fitting nonlinearily with python. There exist good programs for that purpose such as Origin, Igor Pro, Peak-o-mat etc.
